This repository contains the source code of the Scan Demo Capture app by Socket Mobile for iOS. 

Scan Demo Capture is a simple application created to demonstrate integration of the Capture SDK into an iOS application, using Xamarin as the development environment. 


### System information ###

* Runs on Android iOS versions 9.3.5 and higher 
* Requires Socket Mobile Companion (available on the App Store) 
* Developed on a Mac Mini using Visual Studio for Mac


### How to use the app ###

Download and install the Socket Mobile Companion from the App Store. Using the Socket Mobile Companion, configure your Socket scanner for Application mode. Then, compile and run the Scan Demo Capture application on your target device.


This application demonstrates how to integrate the Capture SDK into your iOS application. It does so by keeping a "CaptureHelper" reference in the main ViewController class. This may or may not be the most ideal technique.
Socket is working on additional examples to demonstrate how to open multiple Capture sessions in more than one view controller, as required by your app. An SDK update may be required for this approach to work properly.


### License and agreement ###

The app integrates Socket Mobile Capture SDK and is free for adaptation per your own business needs under Socket Mobile license and user agreements. You will need to join Socket Mobile Developer program to access the SDK and create AppKey for your own application. The Socket Mobile Developer program is free for life with a one time registration fee.
